Code to count nets of hypercubes and hyperoctohedra, up to symmetries.

For nets of simplices, these are in bijection with trees on d+1 vertices, see https://oeis.org/A000055.

A tidier explanation of the hypercube net counter is here

For nets of other regular polytopes (which are of dimension <5), see https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53f62f0fe4b0a7a51b059df3/t/616cb8d3a1e27824a3ad4c84/1634515156259/orthoplex.pdf (who seems to have come up with a similar idea to me independently)
